Overview of PyTorch, Tensors, and NumPy
PyTorch
* TorchScript for creating serializable and optimizable models
* Distributed training to parallelize computations
* Dynamic Computation graphs to make computation graphs


Spatial Orientation
ANN -Artificial neural network 
* Number of parameters increases dramatically
* They lose spatial orientation

CNN-Convolutional neural networks
* First extracts low dimensional features then high dimensional features
* Uses filters to extract features from images and Pooling to reduce parameters
* Dont necessarily need grayscale but it eliminates a layer
* need to resize images to 28*28
